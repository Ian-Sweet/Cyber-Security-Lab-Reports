2. Used Drive Manager to collect disk details.
3. Loaded PhysicalDrive0 in FTK Imager and navigated user directories.
4. Scanned with TreeSizeFree and identified large user files.
5. Ran WinAudit and saved HTML report to external storage.
6. Extracted browser history with BrowsingHistoryView.
7. Ensured all artifacts were saved externally.
8. Verified evidence integrity and closed tools cleanly.
